Q: 给你一个知识QA的agent例子，进行改进，利用我们的semanticmap+semanticgraph来实现，需要体现上面说的混合索引，以及我们数据结构的特色，多列一些具体query，写出代码。

A: 下面给出一个**完整示例**，演示如何把**原有的“知识文档问答”**（即你在示例中使用的长文本切分 + 向量检索 + QA 过程），**改造**为利用我们自定义的 **`SemanticMap`**（向量索引） 和 **`SemanticGraph`**（关系/结构信息） 的方案。在此过程中，既可以保持“向量检索”来做**文本相似度**，又可以利用**图结构**来表达“文档层次、引用关系、多模态信息”等，从而实现“混合索引”和更灵活的 QA。

## 1. 背景：为什么要用 `SemanticMap + SemanticGraph` 改造知识QA

在你的原始例子中，步骤是：

1. **加载长文档**(如爱丽丝漫游仙境) -> **分块**(RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)  
2. **Embedding**(OpenAIEmbeddings) -> 存到一个**FAISS**向量索引  
3. **Retrieval**(向量相似检索) -> 选出最相关文本块  
4. **LLM** (OpenAI/AzureOpenAI) 用这些检索到的文本 + 问题 生成答案

这样能满足基本“基于文档的问答”（Document QA）。  
**但**如果我们想让“文档”的**层次结构**(章节、段落)、**图片/多模态数据**、**引用关系**(文章A引用文章B)、**上下文段落**等信息也能用于检索，就需要在**索引**里也能表示**业务关系**。这正是**`SemanticMap + SemanticGraph`** 的**混合索引**思路：

- **`SemanticMap`**: 用 Faiss/HNSW/IVF等做**embedding**相似检索  
- **`SemanticGraph`**: 用**graph_relations**管理“文档->章节->段落”、“引用关系”、“段落->上一段落” 等关系

## 2. 整体流程概述

1. **长文本切分**: 把文档(如《Alice in Wonderland》)拆成若干段落(chunks)。  
2. **插入**到**`SemanticMap`**: 每个 chunk 作为**key**(文本) + **value**(原文/metadata) -> `semantic_map.insert(...)`  
3. **构造**`SemanticGraph`:  
   - 用**graph_relations**表示**“book -> chapter -> chunk”**等层次关系；  
   - 如果是单一文档，也可以只做**“root -> chunk_i”**；若有多篇文档或多数据源，可以添加更多节点&关系(FAQ, Paper, 互相引用...)。  
4. **构建/更新索引**: `semantic_map.build_or_update_index()`  
5. **query**时：  
   - 先**向量相似检索**(top-k chunk) -> 再**graph**查其上下文(如上/下 chunk, 所属chapter, 等) -> 最后将这些文本一起传给 LLM 生成答案。  
6. **返回**回答给用户，并可**debug**查看graph上下文。

---

## 3. 详细示例代码

下面就是一个**Notebook**式示例，和你给的原始结构类似，但将**Faiss**部分替换/改造为 `SemanticMap` + `SemanticSimpleGraph`。如果你想用HNSW，修改 `SemanticMap(index_type="hnsw")` 即可。

### 3.1 数据准备

1. **加载长文档**(如《Alice in Wonderland》)  
2. **切分**(与之前相同: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`)  
3. **逐段插入**到 `SemanticMap` + `SemanticGraph`。  
4. **Graph**里可以简单做 “AliceBook -> chunk_i (contains)” 这种父子关系。

```python
# knowledge_qa_agent_demo.py

import os
import random
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

# 假设 semantic_map.py  & semantic_simple_graph.py
from semantic_map import SemanticMap
from semantic_simple_graph import SemanticSimpleGraph

def load_long_text(file_path):
    # 读取文本
    loader = TextLoader(file_path)
    docs = loader.load()  # 这里 docs 可能只有一个Document
    return docs

def chunk_text(docs, chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100):
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap)
    chunks = splitter.split_documents(docs)  # list of Document(page_content, metadata)
    return chunks

def build_semantic_graph_from_chunks(chunks, 
                                     doc_key="AliceBook",
                                     doc_title="Alice in Wonderland"):
    # 1) 初始化 semantic_map & graph
    s_map = SemanticMap(
        key_type="text",
        embedding_model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
        embedding_dim=384,
        index_type="flat"  # or "hnsw"
    )
    s_graph = SemanticSimpleGraph(s_map)

    # 2) 新增一个 root 节点: "AliceBook"
    s_graph.add_node(doc_key, {"title": doc_title, "type":"book"}, 
                     parent_keys=None, text_for_embedding=doc_title)
    
    # 3) 对每个 chunk, 做 add_node
    for i, chunk_doc in enumerate(chunks):
        chunk_key = f"{doc_key}_chunk{i}"
        chunk_text = chunk_doc.page_content
        s_graph.add_node(chunk_key,
                         {"type":"chunk", "content": chunk_text},
                         parent_keys=[doc_key],
                         parent_relation="contains",
                         text_for_embedding=chunk_text)
    
    # 4) build index
    s_graph.build_index()
    return s_graph
```

### 3.2 构建一个 `SemanticQAGraphAgent`

这个 Agent 会完成：  
1. **向量检索**：`semantic_map.retrieve_similar(query, k=top_k)`  
2. **graph 查询**：对检索结果做上下文收集(如父节点=AliceBook, sibling chunks, etc.)  
3. **调用LLM**(若想真正回答)；下方只做**demo**打印

```python
from typing import List, Dict
import numpy as np

class SemanticQAGraphAgent:
    def __init__(self, semantic_graph: SemanticSimpleGraph, llm=None):
        self.graph = semantic_graph
        self.semantic_map = semantic_graph.semantic_map
        self.llm = llm  # 这里可以传LangChain的 llm 或 pipeline, demo里先空

    def answer_query(self, query: str, top_k=3, expand_level=1) -> str:
        """
        1) 向量检索 (top_k chunks)
        2) 对每个chunk, 在graph找父节点(书名?), sibling/children?
        3) 拼接上下文 + 问题 => (如果有 llm)就让LLM回答,否则demo返回
        """
        top_results = self.semantic_map.retrieve_similar(query, k=top_k)

        # 收集所有文本上下文
        context_texts = []
        for r in top_results:
            node_key = r["key"]
            node_val = r["value"]
            dist = r["distance"]

            # gather node content
            chunk_text = node_val.get("content", "")
            snippet = f"[NodeKey={node_key}, dist={dist:.2f}] {chunk_text}"

            # get parent => doc?
            parents = self.graph.get_parents(node_key)
            for pkey, prel in parents.items():
                pval = self._find_value(pkey)
                snippet += f"\n(Parent {pkey} type={pval.get('type')} title={pval.get('title','')})"

            context_texts.append(snippet)

        # 简单拼接上下文
        combined_context = "\n\n".join(context_texts)
        prompt = f"Context:\n{combined_context}\n\nQuestion: {query}\nAnswer:"
        
        if self.llm is not None:
            # 用 LLM 生成回答
            answer = self.llm(prompt)
            return answer
        else:
            # demo 仅返回 prompt
            return f"(No LLM) Here is the combined context:\n{prompt}"

    def _find_value(self, node_key):
        for (k,v,emb) in self.semantic_map.data:
            if k==node_key:
                return v
        return {}

```

### 3.3 测试若干具体 Query

在**Notebook**里可以这样做：

```python
def main_demo():
    # 1) 加载文本, eg. ../data/wonderland.txt
    docs = load_long_text("../data/wonderland.txt")
    chunks = chunk_text(docs, chunk_size=800, chunk_overlap=100)
    
    # 2) build semantic graph
    s_graph = build_semantic_graph_from_chunks(chunks, doc_key="AliceBook", doc_title="Alice in Wonderland")
    
    # 3) init agent
    qa_agent = SemanticQAGraphAgent(s_graph, llm=None)  # llm=None 简化
    
    # 4) queries
    queries = [
        "What does the author describe the Alice following with?", 
        "Who is the main character in this book?",
        "What is the difference between rabbit and cat?"
    ]
    
    for q in queries:
        print(f"\n=== Q: {q} ===")
        ans = qa_agent.answer_query(q, top_k=2)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_demo()
```

在这段**demo**中，每个 Query 都会做以下过程：  
1. 先用**`SemanticMap`**(Faiss)做embedding搜索 -> top-2 chunk；  
2. 对**每个 chunk**显示**NodeKey**、**distance**，再**graph.get_parents**看是否属于“**AliceBook**”；  
3. 最后**拼接**成一个**Context** + 问题的 Prompt，demo 里没实际调用 LLM，只输出即可；若你想**调用**LangChain/OpenAI，可把**llm**换成**pipeline**或**OpenAI**接口。  

---

## 4. 更多可扩展的 Query

1. **“Find me any mention of ‘Agent memory’ usage in the FAQ or references from Paper1”**  
   - 可能需要**多文档**：paper1, paper2, 还有**FAQ**节点 => 先embedding搜 => 若匹配到 FAQ chunk => see if FAQ->paper1 in graph => gather.  
2. **“Paper1 references Paper2. Does Paper2 mention HPC architecture?”**  
   - 先**graph**: `paper1->paper2 (references)` => then search inside `paper2`’s chunk embedding => see if HPC architecture is mentioned.  
3. **“Which chunk is the introduction? Return the chunk text + next chunk.”**  
   - Could do**embedding**: “introduction” => top chunk => then **graph**: get next chunk => combine.

---

# 结语

通过上述**示例**，我们把你在Notebook里使用的**长文档QA**流程**升级**到**`SemanticMap + SemanticSimpleGraph`**的**混合索引**方法：

- **`SemanticMap`** 继续提供**embedding相似检索**，依靠Faiss/HNSW/IVF；  
- **`SemanticGraph`** 记录**文档与段落**、**FAQ**、**paper之间引用**等结构化关系；  
- **查询/回答**时，Agent先embedding找相关内容，再顺着Graph找上下文/引用 => 生成更丰富回答。  

**这样**就不只是单纯“文本切分 + 向量数据库”，而是**可以随时对节点做关系扩展**（paper->paper, doc->faq, etc.），也能**在查询后**拿到**子图**(父子、links)一起提供给 LLM 进行最终回答。希望这个示例能帮你更好地**整合**“知识文档问答”与“SemanticMap+SemanticGraph”的特色。祝你在项目中顺利落地!



Q: 我感觉小说好像不太适合这个case，是否可以换成wikipedia QA，因为wiki里面有文字、图表、链接等多模态和关系数据，写一个完整代码，就叫Wikipedia-QA-agent.py，用上我们的semanticmap+semanticgraph，体现关系和相似度查询。同时也尝试之前说的两种索引方法：(1) 分开索引：semanticmap主要是向量索引，semanticgraph是关系索引。（2）将向量索引HNSW之间建立在semanticgraph里，成为向量+关系混合索引。

A: 下面给出一个较为完整的示例脚本 **`Wikipedia-QA-agent.py`**，示范如何将 **Wikipedia** 数据导入到 **`SemanticMap`** + **`SemanticGraph`**，并实现**知识型 QA**。同时演示了**两种索引方法**：

1. **“分层式”**（SemanticMap 负责向量检索，SemanticGraph 只存关系；查询时先向量检索 top-k，再调用图结构获取上下文）；  
2. **“一体化”**（在 SemanticGraph 里直接维护“embedding相似边”，实现一个简易 HNSW-like 图；查询可以同时考虑 embedding 与关系）。  

为简便起见，这里**假设**我们只取了 Wikipedia 的一部分（例如300篇随机采样）进行演示。若要大规模使用，需要更多工程化处理（批量下载、数据清洗等）。

## 1. 数据准备：简化版 Wikipedia

1. **获取 Wikipedia 数据**：可以使用 [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia) 或 [KILT-Wikipedia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kilt_wikipedia) 等；  
2. **随机抽取** N=300 篇文章（demo规模），对每篇文章做**简单段落切分**，再插入到 `SemanticMap + SemanticGraph`。  
3. **多模态**（图片）与**Wiki内链**：  
   - 如果想演示图片embedding，需要解析 Wiki 中图片链接+caption(用CLIP embedding)；  
   - 如果想演示文章间链接，需要记录 `articleA -> articleB (hyperlink)` 关系。  
   - 这部分可灵活取舍。示例里仅演示**文字段落+内链**即可。

**以下示例**假设已经把 Wikipedia 数据读成了 `(title, text, links, maybe images)` 这样的结构；不再详细演示爬/加载过程。你可自行实现 `load_small_wiki()`。

---

## 2. 第一种方式：分层式索引

### 2.1 构建数据到 `SemanticMap + SemanticSimpleGraph`

**思路**：  
- **`SemanticMap`** 用 `Faiss` 或 `IndexHNSWFlat` 做**向量检索**(embedding)；  
- **`SemanticGraph`** 只存**业务关系**（“wikiArticle -> paragraph(s)”、“articleA->articleB(链接)”、可选的“article->image”）。  
- 查询时：**先**embedding top-k => **再**图扩展上下文(获取同一文章其余段落、相关链接、等)。

## 3. 第二种方式：一体化索引 (HNSW + 关系)

接着我们演示**“将向量索引HNSW直接建立在semanticgraph里”**，即**在图中加“embedding相似”边**(top-k近邻)；再在查询时做**graph-based**搜索(如 BFS/greedy)来找最相似节点，然后可以**顺便**访问**业务关系**(parent/links)也都在这张图里。

### 3.1 在 `SemanticGraph` 里添加“embedding相似边”

可以基于**`HybridGraph`**(或**`SemanticSimpleGraph`**的子类)思路——参考之前回答中给出的“`HybridGraph`”例子。下方仅再贴简化要点：

```python

    """

        super().add_node(key, value, parent_keys, parent_relation, text_for_embedding)
        # 把embedding存到 self.node_embeddings
        for (k, v, emb) in self.semantic_map.data:
            if k == key:
                self.node_embeddings[key] = emb
                break

    def build_embedding_edges(self, top_k=3):

        dim = self.semantic_map.embedding_dim

        index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)
        index.add(arr_emb)

        # 给每个节点加top_k embedding边

        if not self.node_embeddings:

        while pq and len(results)<top:
            cur_dist, cur_key = heapq.heappop(pq)
            results.append((cur_key,cur_dist))
            # expand embedding_sim neighbors
            links = self.get_links(cur_key)
            for lk, rel in links.items():
                if "embedding_sim" in rel and lk not in visited:
                    visited.add(lk)
                    d = float(np.linalg.norm(query_emb - self.node_embeddings[lk]))
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (d, lk))
        return results
```

### 3.2 用一个**`WikiQAHNSWAgent`**来查询

跟**方案A**不同，这里**不**调用**`semantic_map.retrieve_similar`**，而是**`graph.graph_search(query_emb)`**直接在图里做**embedding_sim**搜索：

```python
class WikiQAHNSWAgent:
    def __init__(self, hnsw_graph: HNSWGraph, text_encoder=None):
        self.graph = hnsw_graph
        self.encoder = text_encoder or SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

    def answer_query(self, query, top=3):
        # 1) compute query_emb
        q_emb = self.encoder.encode([query], convert_to_numpy=True)[0].astype(np.float32)
        # 2) graph_search
        results = self.graph.graph_search(q_emb, top=top)
        
        # gather info
        final_context = ""
        for (node_key, dist) in results:
            val = self._get_value(node_key)
            final_context += f"[{node_key}, d={dist:.2f}]{val}\n"
            # e.g. get parents
            parents = self.graph.get_parents(node_key)
            if parents:
                final_context += f"parents:{parents}\n"
        return f"Context:\n{final_context}\nQuestion: {query}"

    def _get_value(self, k):
        for (key,v,emb) in self.graph.semantic_map.data:
            if key==k:
                return v
        return {}
```

### 3.3 测试查询

```python
def demo_hnsw_style():
    # 1) load wiki data
    wiki_data = load_small_wiki(num_articles=5) # small
    # 2) build a HNSWGraph
    sem_map = SemanticMap(...)
    hnsw_graph = HNSWGraph(sem_map)
    # insert wiki data
    for article in wiki_data:
        art_key = article["title"]
        art_val = {"type":"wiki_article","title":article["title"],"links":article["links"]}
        hnsw_graph.add_node(art_key, art_val, text_for_embedding=article["title"])
        # paragraphs
        paragraphs = split_paragraphs(article["text"])
        for i,p in enumerate(paragraphs):
            p_key = f"{art_key}_p{i}"
            p_val = {"type":"paragraph","content":p}
            hnsw_graph.add_node(p_key, p_val, parent_keys=[art_key], parent_relation="contains", text_for_embedding=p)
        for linkTitle in article["links"]:
            hnsw_graph._ensure_node(linkTitle)
            hnsw_graph.insert_edge(art_key, linkTitle, relation="wiki_link")
    # 3) build index => sem_map
    hnsw_graph.build_index()
    # 4) build embedding_sim edges
    hnsw_graph.build_embedding_edges(top_k=2)
    # 5) init agent
    agent = WikiQAHNSWAgent(hnsw_graph)
    # queries
    queries=["agent memory method","what is HPC?","tell me about DemoArticle_2"]
    for q in queries:
        print(f"\n=== Q: {q} ===")
        ans = agent.answer_query(q, top=2)
        print(ans)
```

**这样**就能在**Graph**中一次性存了**向量相似度边**(embedding_sim)和**wiki_link**(文章链接) & “contains” (article->paragraph)等关系。  
查询**graph_search**只**遍历embedding_sim**边（演示**HNSW**式搜索），然后也可**查看**`parents`(article) 或 `links`(hyperlink) 等**业务关系**。无需单独调 `semantic_map.retrieve_similar`。

---

# 结语

- **Wikipedia** 场景**更贴近**“多模态、引用、上下文”需求；  
- **方案A（分层）**：对大规模Wiki一般更简单可行，Faiss/HNSWlib做**embedding**，Graph只存**业务关系**；  
- **方案B（一体化）**：更“**混合**”，但需要**手动维护**embedding近邻边；对**大规模**Wiki构建**HNSW图**要谨慎性能；  
- **无论哪种**：都可以在**查询**时既利用**embedding相似度**，又利用**graph**(上下文关系: article->paragraph, hyperlink to other articles, etc.)，为**QA** 提供更**丰富**的上下文。  

由此，**`Wikipedia-QA-agent.py`** 就能示范**SemanticMap + SemanticGraph**的“混合索引”特色：  
1. 向量检索(embedding)；  
2. 结构化关系(wiki_link, parent->child)；  
3. 同时支持“找相似段落 + 引用/上下文”融合回答。  

如需**真实多模态**(图片embedding), 只要给**image**节点插入embedding + edge=(article->image)即可，也是同理。祝你项目或研究中一切顺利!


A: 下面给出一个**示例**，展示如何在**知识型 QA（Knowledge QA）**场景下，利用现有的 `SemanticMap` + `SemanticSimpleGraph` 构建一个**“混合索引”**（既能向量搜索，又能利用业务关系/结构信息）的**Agent**。示例里会：

1. **定义一个简单的“KnowledgeQAAgent”**，用来处理自然语言 Query；  
2. **利用 `SemanticMap`**（向量检索）**+ `SemanticSimpleGraph`**（结构/关系）来完成检索；  
3. **列出几个具体 Query**（既涉及向量相似度，又需要结构化信息）；  
4. **演示最小原型代码**，帮助你理解如何整合“混合索引”和“数据结构特色”到一个 Q&A 流程中。

> **注意**：此示例是一个可运行的**最小原型**，你可根据实际项目做更大规模数据导入、提示工程、LLM对话上下文整合等。

# 目录

1. **示例数据准备**  
2. **核心类：KnowledgeQAAgent**  
3. **查询示例**  
4. **完整示例代码**  

---

## 1. 示例数据准备

为了展示“**混合索引**”与“**业务/结构关系**”并举，我们假设有如下数据：

- **Paper1**，包含两个段落：`paper1_sec1`, `paper1_sec2`，并且 Paper1 引用了 Paper2；  
- **Paper2**，包含1个段落 `paper2_sec1`；  
- **FAQ1**，一个FAQ文档 (也可以理解成“知识库”的条目)。  
- 所有这些节点，都可以插入到 `SemanticSimpleGraph`，并在 `SemanticMap` 中保存它们的embedding（文本向量）。  
- 关系示例：  
  - `paper1 -> paper1_sec1` (contains)  
  - `paper1 -> paper1_sec2` (contains)  
  - `paper1 -> paper2` (references)  
  - `FAQ1` 独立一个节点，也可与 Paper1 形成一些 `links` if needed  

通过这种简单数据，我们可以演示**向量检索**（embedding相似）**+**“paper->sec”**+**“paper->paper”**关系。

---

## 2. 核心类：KnowledgeQAAgent

### 整体流程

1. **Agent**接收用户自然语言 Query；  
2. **Optionally** 解析 Query（若需要更复杂过滤），这里简化；  
3. **在 SemanticMap** 里进行向量搜索(`retrieve_similar`)获取 top-k 节点；  
4. **在 SemanticSimpleGraph** 里为每个 top-k 节点查询上下文：**父节点**(paper?)、**子节点**(段落?)、**links**(references?), …；  
5. 最终**汇总**回答给用户。

可以写一个**`answer_query`**方法，把这些步骤封装起来。  

---

## 3. 查询示例

以下几个 Query 可以体现**混合索引**与**结构**：

1. **“请找到与 ‘Agent memory’ 最相关的段落，然后把它所在的论文标题也给我”**  
   - 向量检索：“Agent memory” -> top-k 段落；  
   - Graph：段落 -> (parents) paper -> 取paper的标题 => 整合回答。  

2. **“有哪些 FAQ 条目中也提到了 ‘Agent memory usage’? 如果 FAQ 链接到了 Paper1，就一并返回 Paper1 的摘要”**  
   - 向量检索：top-k = FAQ nodes, filter type=FAQ?  
   - Graph：看 FAQ 是否有 `links->paper1` => 如果有，就查 paper1 的 content/摘要 => 整合。  

3. **“Paper1 引用了哪些论文里，也有‘Agent memory’描述的段落？请列出这些段落内容”**  
   - Graph：**paper1->paper2**(references) => paper2->(child)**paper2_sec1** => embedding搜索 “Agent memory” 之上再看看这个 sec1 是否相似 => 返回。  
   - （也可先embedding搜 => 再对top-k中检查是不是paper2子节点 => 例子多样）  

示例中我们会写**2～3个查询**来说明流程。

### 代码说明

1. **setup_demo_data**：插入 Paper/Section/FAQ 等节点到 `SemanticSimpleGraph`，并调用 `build_index()`（即 `SemanticMap.build_or_update_index()`）。  
2. **KnowledgeQAAgent**：  
   - `answer_query`:  
     1) 用 `semantic_map.retrieve_similar(query, top_k)` 找embedding最相似节点；  
     2) 利用 `semantic_graph` 的 `get_parents/get_children/get_links` 获取节点关系（比如paper->title），在**paper_parent_titles**里演示如何获取paper标题。  
   - 你可在**真实项目**中再把**结果**拼给 LLM做**final回答**。  
3. **demo_queries**：列出三种查询，演示**向量检索 + 关系**相结合的最小示例。

---

# 总结

- **思路**：  
  - 定义一个**Agent**：在 `answer_query` 时，**先**利用 `semantic_map` 做**embedding相似检索**，**再**利用 `semantic_graph` 查询**上下文或引用关系**，最后组装结果给用户。  
- **数据结构特色**：  
  - `SemanticMap` 管理**向量检索**（flat/HNSW/IVF...），`SemanticSimpleGraph` 管理**父子/引用/link**等业务结构；  
  - 在一个 Agent QA 流程中，**embedding** & **关系**都能得到用武之地，构成“混合索引/查询”能力。  
- **更多查询**：  
  - 你可以新增**“paper->paper references”**多跳，或**faq->paper** “links” => 让 Agent 可一次拿到更复杂的**子图**回答。  
  - 也能**扩展**：如**段落->前/后段**(上下文)，**多模态**(images embedding)...

这样，你就拥有一个**简易 Knowledge QA Agent**，能**检索**并**组合**不同节点的信息。再配合**LLM**(如 `gpt-3.5-turbo`)做**final summary**，就能形成**更丰富**的**RAG**流程。希望这个示例对你将**SemanticMap + SemanticSimpleGraph**用于“混合索引+结构关系”场景有所帮助!

      "  \"context\": \"But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:— First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream. The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. \\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. “Herald, read the accusation!” said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. “He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?” So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!” So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. “This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your history, she do.” “I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.” So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, “I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’t begin.” But she waited patiently. “Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.” These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life. The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense. The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask her about it.” “She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow. The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\"\n",
